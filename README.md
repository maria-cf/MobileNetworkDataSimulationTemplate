# MobileNetworkDataSimulationTemplate
Data and code repository for the geolocation statistical process with simulated mobile network data

# Description
This is a repository for both data and code to execute the geolocation statistical process from raw mobile telecommunication network event data to target population estimates. 

Data are synthetic generated by a [network event data simulator](https://github.com/MobilePhoneESSnetBigData/simulator) developed by Work Package I of the European project [ESSnet on Big Data II](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/essnetbigdata/index.php/Main_Page).

# Data
Different types of data need to be integrated to reach final estimates about the target population. Basically:
* **Network configuration data**: data regarding how the mobile telecommunication network is configured. This data allows the analyst to build a so-called radio wave propagation model.
* **Network event data**: data regarding the digital trace of every device in the network (cell ID, Timing Advance, timestamp, etc.). 
* **Population data**: data from an external source to the network (certainly with coarser degree of space and time breakdown) with the kind of estimates about the whole target population.
* **Telecommunication market data**: data from the market of mobile telecommunications such as penetration rates or market shares.
* **Auxiliary information**: data from external sources providing information about land use, transport networks, and similar.

All data in this project are synthetic.

# Process
The whole process is designed according to a sequence of production process steps with some input data and input parameters and a throughput process producing output data and metrics (see figure).

 Apart from the generation of synthetic data from the network event data simulator, we are focusing on the geolocation module, which provides location probability distributions for each mobile device accross the whole geographical territory of analysis.
 
 # Folder Structure
 
 * **code**: it contains both the source code of standalone functions and packages and scripts to execute the statistical process.
 * **data**: it contains the sequence of input, intermediate, and output data of the whole process, organised in subfolders
   - *eventLocProb*: it contains the so-called event location probabilities associated to each grid tile and network event datum arising from the adopted radio wave propagation model.
   - *networkEvents*: it contains the data generated by each device in its interaction with the telecommunication network during its displacement.
   - *postLocProb*: it contains the probability distributions of each device location.
   - *simulatorConfig*: it contains the files with the configuration of the simulator providing the syntehtic scenario.
 * **territory_and_grid**: it contains graphical representations and images in general.
 * **param**: it contains both global parameters (in subfolder *resources*) and specific process parameters (in subfolder *process*). Information about the (simulated) ground truth is also contained here (in real production conditions this never exists).
